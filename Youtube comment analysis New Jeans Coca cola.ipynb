      "NewJeans MV's doesn't feel overproduced leaving the impression that they are just a bunch of friends having fun and not industry plants. Their choreo also seems playful and not overly strict leaving the raw feeling that allows the viewers to feel connected. Usually artists feel like they are levels above but NJ just seems to have a different kind of connection with their audience. big fan of the company and the direction they are heading towards.\n",

That's the first time New Jeans has missed me.\" The verses were great, but it was that chorus, man. I couldn't listen to it without cringing inside... It's been a month or so and I've listened to it over and over when it pops up in my playlists and youtube mixes... and honestly, I friking love this song in spite of the #ad in it. Heck, I even like the chorus now. It's stuck in my head!\n",
